# Eclipse Rive Animation

This file should contain a Rive animation with:

## Structure
- Artboard with State Machine named "ECLIPSE"
- Boolean input named "totality"

## Visual Elements
- Eclipse ring
- Corona glow effect
- Smooth transitions between states

## States
- Normal eclipse (totality = false)
- Total eclipse with corona (totality = true)

## How to create
1. Go to https://rive.app
2. Create new file
3. Design eclipse with ring and corona
4. Add State Machine named "ECLIPSE"
5. Add Boolean input "totality"
6. Create transition animations
7. Export as "eclipse.riv"
8. Place in assets/ folder

For now, the app will gracefully handle missing file.
